Decreased the minimum deployment target of `AugmentedFaces` to iOS 9.0 (from 10.0).

Bug fixes and performance improvements.

Version 1.12.0 (2019-09-12)
===========================
  * The ARCore CocoaPod has been divided into two subspecs, `CloudAnchors` and `AugmentedFaces`. `AugmentedFaces` is new for this release. (These libraries are not yet designed to work together.)

  * The `AugmentedFaces` subspec allows you to implement ARCore's Augmented Faces feature on iOS. To read more about Augmented Faces, see https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/ios/augmented-faces/overview

  * The Cloud Anchors feature has changed as follows.
    * The data captured by `hostCloudAnchor:error:` and uploaded to the ARCore Cloud Anchor API service has changed. See https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/ios/cloud-anchors/overview#how-hosted to learn more.
    * `resolveCloudAnchorWithIdentifier:error:` will no longer time out or fail when the ARCore Cloud Anchor API service is unreachable or the anchor cannot be immediately resolved. Instead, the API continues to attempt to resolve the provided anchors until they are removed.
      * The `ErrorResolvingLocalizationNoMatch` and `ErrorServiceUnavailable` enums in `GARCloudAnchorState` are now deprecated and will no longer be returned. For hosted anchors only, the new value `ErrorHostingServiceUnavailable` may be returned.
    * Cloud Anchors is now supported on all ARKit-compatible devices. New devices will be supported immediately with this release.


Version 1.11.0 (2019-08-05)
===========================
Increased the minimum deployment target to iOS 9.0 (from iOS 8.0).

Bug fixes and performance improvements.
  * Added support for devices:
    * iPod Touch (7th gen).

ARCore is now robust to tracking resets.

Version 1.7.0 (2019-02-14)
==========================
Bug fixes and performance improvements.

Version 1.6.0 (2018-12-06)
==========================
Added the ability to target iOS versions prior to 11.0. The binary now contains
32-bit architectures, and the README documents three version numbers: minimum
deployment target, minimum base SDK, and minimum version for runtime support.
  * Added support for devices:
    * iPhone: XS, XS Max, XR.
    * iPad Pro: 11 inch, 12.9 inch (3rd gen).

Version 1.5.0 (2018-09-27)
==========================
Added the ability for new devices to be supported without an SDK update.

Resolved Issues:
  * Fixed an issue where ARCore would not compile if used with Firebase Firestore.

Version 1.4.0 (2018-08-02)
==========================
Resolved Issues:
  * Fixed an issue where hosting and resolving Cloud Anchors would fail on iOS 12 with the new 4:3 aspect ratio.
  * Fixed an issue where ARCore would not compile if used with Firebase Messaging.

Version 1.3.0 (2018-06-21)
==========================
Adds support for ARKit-compatible iPads. These include:
  * iPad: 5th and 6th generation
  * iPad Pro: 12.9 inch (1st and 2nd gen), 10.5 inch, 9.7 inch

Resolved Issues:
  * Fixed an issue where an invalid API key for the ARCore Cloud Anchor Service would result in a cloud anchor state of `GARCloudAnchorStateErrorInternal`. The error state will now be `GARCloudAnchorStateErrorNotAuthorized`.

Version 1.2.1 (2018-05-30)
==========================
Resolved Issues:
  * Removed SDK references to `ARFaceAnchor`. The `hostCloudAnchor:` implementation no longer checks that the passed in `ARAnchor` is not an `ARFaceAnchor`, and no longer forcibly exits with `GARSessionErrorCodeAnchorNotSupportedForHosting`. However, use of `ARFaceAnchor`s remains unsupported in this release.

Version 1.2.0 (2018-05-08)
==========================
Initial release alongside ARCore 1.2 on Android.
  * Support for Cloud Anchors.
  * Supported devices: iPhone X, 8, 8+, 7, 7+, 6S, 6S+, SE.

Known Issues:
  * An invalid API key for the ARCore Cloud Anchor Service will result in a Cloud Anchor state of `GARCloudAnchorStateErrorInternal` instead of `GARCloudAnchorStateErrorNotAuthorized`. This is a known issue and will be fixed in an upcoming release.
