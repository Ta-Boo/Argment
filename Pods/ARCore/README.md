# Installation

To integrate ARCore SDK for iOS into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify
it in your `Podfile`:

```
target 'YOUR_APPLICATION_TARGET_NAME_HERE'
platform :ios, '11.0'
pod 'ARCore/SUBSPEC_NAME_HERE' ~> VERSION_HERE
```

Lower deployment targets (down to 9.0) will build, but the API won't be
functional at runtime unless iOS version >= 11.0. Also, you must be building
with at least version 13.0 of the iOS SDK.

Then, run the following command:

```
$ pod install
```

Before you can start using the Cloud Anchors API, you will need to register an
API key in the
[Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com/) for the
ARCore Cloud Anchor service.
